Mainly `Julia` stuff, but also some `c`, `perl`, and whatever else I end up
studying :)

- The [code](https://github.com/brunaw/jubs/tree/master/code) folder
contains the `Julia` part, with basic code and ML things. 

- The [`c`](https://github.com/brunaw/jubs/tree/master/c) and [`perl`](https://github.com/brunaw/jubs/tree/master/perl) folders are basic scripts for those languages.

- The [assignment](https://github.com/brunaw/jubs/blob/master/assignment) folder relates to one assignment I made, where I
use `c` and `perl` inside `R` (https://github.com/brunaw/jubs/blob/master/assignment/report.pdf).
