"1" "Once I hoped  To seek the new unknown This planet's overrun There's nothing left  For you or for me  Don't give in We can walk through the fields And feeling nature's glow  But all the land is owned There's none left  For you or for me  Who will win? 'Cause I can concede  Free me Free me Free me from this world  I don't belong here It was a mistake imprisoning my soul Can you free me Free me from this world  A world lush in bloom With rivers running wild They'll be rerouted South With none left  For you or for me  Don't give in And hear the engines roar And save our crops from drought But when the black gold's in doubt There's none left  For you or for me  Fuse hellium-3 Our last hope  And free me And free me Free me from this world  We don't belong here It was a mistake imprisoning our souls Can you free me Free me from this world   Free me I'll free you Free us from this world  We don't belong here It was a mistake imprisoning our souls Can you free me Free me from this world  Free me Free me Free me from this world  We don't belong here It was a mistake imprisoning our souls Can you free me Free me from this world  Shh Go to sleep"
