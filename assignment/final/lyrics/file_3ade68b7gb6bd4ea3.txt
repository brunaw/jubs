"1" "Too late Yeah baby it's too late And time has made the spell obey And now it's trying to desicrate  But we had a dream And it was meant to be And we are kissing gods Against all the odds  Now it's a crying shame Well it's a crying shame You don't know who to blame Will never be the same And it's a crying shame  Too much And we demolished too much An yeah we really fucked it up An yeah baby you lost your touch  But we had a dream And it was meant to be And we are kissing gods Against all the odds  Now it's a crying shame Well it's a crying shame You don't know who to blame Will never be the same  And it's a crying shame Well it's a crying shame"
