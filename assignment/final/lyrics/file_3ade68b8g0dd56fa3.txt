You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off  you.  Pardon the way that I stare. There's nothing else to compare. The sight of you makes me weak. There are no words left to speak, But if you feel like I feel, Please let me know that it's real. You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you.  I love you, baby, And if it's quite alright, I need you, baby, To warm a lonely night. I love you, baby. Trust in me when i say: Oh, pretty baby, Don't bring me down, I pray. Oh pretty baby, now that i found you, stay And let me love you, baby. Let me love you.  You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off  you. You feel like heaven to touch. I wanna hold you so much. At long last love has arrived And I thank God I'm alive. You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off  you.  I love you baby, And if it's quite alright, I need you, baby, To warm a lonely night. I love you, baby. Trust in me when I say: Oh, pretty baby, Don't bring me down, I pray. Oh pretty baby, now that i found you stay And let me love you, baby. Let me love you..."
