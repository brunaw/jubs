"1" "Help me, I've fallen on the inside I tried to change the game, I try to infiltrate, but now I'm losing Men in cloaks, always seems to run the show Save me from the, ghosts and shadows Before they eat my soul  Mercy Mercy Show me mercy, from the powers that be Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?  Absent gods and silent tyranny We're going under, hypnotized by another puppeteer And tell me why the men in cloaks Always has to bring me down Running from the ghosts and shadows The world just disavows  Mercy Mercy Show me mercy, from the powers that be Show me mercy, can someone rescue me? Show me mercy Show me mercy, please  Help me, I've fallen on the inside And all the men in cloaks trying to devour my soul  Show me mercy from the powers that be Show me mercy from the gutless and mean Show me mercy from the killing machines Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?"
