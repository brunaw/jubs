Who remains (just to spit it in your face)  You know that I don't want you and I never did I don't want you and I never will  You wanted far more than I was worth And you think I was scared yeah And you needed proof Who really cares anymore? Who restrains (just to spit it in your face)  You know that I don't love you and I never did I don't want you and I never will Waahhh"
