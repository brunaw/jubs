"1" "I cannot sleep  There's too much noise in my head  I cannot sleep  I want it here instead  I never thought that this could come to this I just wanna look at your face in peace now  You'll never miss  But I can  I cannot keep  The shame that's clawed us out  I will not keep  Your shut-up, shut-up lies  I never thought that this could come to this  I just wanna live in bliss, in peace now  You will never miss  But I can"
