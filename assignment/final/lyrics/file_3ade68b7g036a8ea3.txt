"1" "Fear and panic in the air I want to be free From desolation and despair And I feel like everything I saw Is being swept away And I refuse to let you go  I can't get it right Get it right Since I met you  Loneliness be over When will this loneliness be over?  Life will flash before my eyes So scared to be lost I want to touch the other side And the world Thinks they are to blame Why can't we see That when we bleed we bleed the same  I can't get it right Get it Righ T Since I met you  Loneliness be over When will this loneliness be over? Loneliness be over When will this loneliness be over?    Fear, our future on the run Running away And our judgement has began No one Thinks they are to blame Why can't we see When we bleed we bleed the same"
