"1" "I think I'm drowning Asphyxiated I wanna break this spell That you've created  You're something beautiful A contradiction I wanna play the game I want the friction  You will be the death of me Yeah, You will be the death of me  Bury it I won't let you bury it I won't let you smother it I won't let you murder it  And our time is running out And our time is running out You can't push it underground We can't stop it screaming out  I wanted freedom Bound and restricted I tried to give you up But I'm addicted  Now that you know I'm trapped Sense of elation You'll never dream of breaking this fixation You will squeeze the life out of me  Bury it I won't let you bury it I won't let you smother it I won't let you murder it  And our time is running out And our time is running out You can't push it underground We can't stop it screaming out  How did it come to this Ooooh yayayayaya Ooooh yayayayaya Ooooh yaya yeah yeah yeeaah!  You will suck the life out of me  Bury it I won't let you bury it I won't let you smother it I won't let you murder it  Our time is running out And our time is running out You can't push it underground We can't stop it screaming out  How did it come to this Ooooh yayayayaya Ooooh yayayayaya Ooooh yaya yeah yeah yeeaah!"
