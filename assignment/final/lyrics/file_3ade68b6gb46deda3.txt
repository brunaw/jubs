"1" "You could be my unintended choice To live my life extended You could be the one I'll always love  You could be the one who listens to my  Deepest inquisitions You could be the one I'll always love  I'll be there as soon as I can But I'm busy Mending broken Pieces of the life I had before  First there was the one who challenged All my dreams and all my balance She could never be as good as you  You could be my unintended choice To live my life extended You should be the one I'll always love  I'll be there as soon as I can But I'm busy mending broken Pieces of the life I had before  (repeat)  Before you"
