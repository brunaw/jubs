"1" "The truth is like when I am killing in order to survive I have never felt so alive I am always seeking to live and die on the edge Life is a broken simulation I'm unable to feel I'm searching for something that's real I am always seeking to see what's behind the veil  Trapped in a maze of unseen walls These blockades must fall  Crush, crush Where's the rush? Seize, fight for your life Smash, test Beat the best Fight for your life Leave me inside now  I never sleep or rest But I'm still running out of time I have sacrificed all of my life The time has come to To prove to you what I'm worth  Trapped in a maze of endless walls These blockades must fall  Crush, crush Where's the rush? Seize, fight for your life Smash, test Beat the best Fight for your life Leave me inside now  Crush, crush Where is the rush? Seize, fight for your life Smash, test Beat the best Fight for your life Leave me inside now"
