"1" "We would kiss for the life we've earned, Someone's sold all the truth you yearned. Remember when we used to shine, And had no fear of sense of time...  Creeps up in me...  We can't cry now there's nothing to feel.. Noone's noticed our loneliness.. Remember when you used to tease, And made us scream eternal time..  I can't believe that you've always been here, Cause once you promised a life with no fear. Please don't break my ideals! And say what's fake, was always real!  I was the one, One and only! Take me back again..."
