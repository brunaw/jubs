"1" "I'm sick of feeding my soul To people who'll never know Just how purposeless and empty they've grown Because the language confuses Like computers refuse to Understand how i'm feeling today  I'm freezing and losing my way I don't need another map of your head I am freezing and losing my way I don't need another map of your head  I saw a liquid control That gives life to us all I hit my head on it and woke up to know That i was all alone Wearing just socks and a phone Someone screaming like their world might explode  yeah i'm freezing and losing my way I don't need another map of your head I'm freezing and losing my way I don't want another map of your head  I'm freezing and losing my way I don't want another map of your head I'm freezing and losing my way I don't need another map of your head yeah "
