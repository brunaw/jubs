"1" "Too late Yeah baby it's too late And time has made the spell abate And now it's time to desecrate  But we had a dream And it was meant to be And we were kissing gods Against all the odds  Now it's a crying shame And it's a crying shame We don't know who to blame It'll never be the same And it's a crying shame  Too much We demolish too much And yeah we've really fucked it up Yeah baby you lost your touch  But we had a dream And it was meant to be And we were kissing gods Against all the odds  Now it's a crying shame And it's a crying shame You don't know who to blame It'll never be the same And it's a crying shame  And it's a crying shame"
