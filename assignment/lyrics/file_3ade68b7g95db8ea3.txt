"1" "Come into my life Regress into a dream We will hide Build a new reality Draw another picture Of the life you could have had Follow your instincts And choose the other path  You should never be afraid You're protected from trouble and pain Why, Why is this a crisis in your eyes again  Come to be How did it come to be Tied to a railroad No love to set us free Watch our souls fade away And our bodies crumbling Don't be afraid  I will take the blow for you  And I've had recurring nightmares That I was loved for who I am And missed the opportunity to be a better man."
