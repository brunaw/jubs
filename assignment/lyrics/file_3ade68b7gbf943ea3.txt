So romantic that you cry  There's always something that will makes you kiss me There's also something that I would tell you or tell me  We should blow up this now It's all because of mine Don't people see yourself Cause I can't pray for I never needed your cry I love your cry That's romantic cause I need you so  I know that you're ashamed So romantic that accuse you Don't you know that you're ashamed ? So romantic that accuse you "
