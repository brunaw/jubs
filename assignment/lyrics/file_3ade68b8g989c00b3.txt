"1" "Take me for a ride Break me up and steal what's left inside And hope and pray inequity has died And sigh enough to stop  I'm on red alert Bring me peace and wash away my dirt Spin me 'round and help me to divert And walk into the light  Warm my heart tonight And hold my head up high And help me to survive  Kick me when I'm down Feed me poison, fill me 'til I drown Wake me up before I get pushed out And fall into the night  Warm my heart tonight And hold my head up high And help me to survive"
