"1" "You would say anything and you would try anything to escape your meaningless and your insignificance You're uncontrollable and we are unloveable And I don't want you to think that I care I never would, I never could again  Why can't you just love her? And why be such a monster? You bully from a distance Your brain needs some assistance  But I'll still take all the blame Cos you and me are both one and the same And it's driving me mad And it's driving me mad I'll take back all the things that I said I didn't realise I was talking to the living dead But I don't want you to think that I care I never would I never could again  You would say anything and you would try anything To escape your meaningless and your insignificance "
