"1" "The wavelength gently grows, Coercive notions re-evolve, A universe is trapped inside a tear, It resonates the core, Creates unnatural laws, Replaces love and happiness with fear  How much deception can you take? How many lies will you create? How much longer until you break? Your mind's about to fall  And they are breaking through, They are breaking through, Now we're falling, We are losing control  Invisible to all, The mind becomes a wall. All of history deleted with one stroke  How much deception can you take? How many lies will you create? How much longer until you break? Your minds about to fall  And they are breaking through, They are breaking through, Now were falling, We are losing control"
