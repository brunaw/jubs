"1" "Leave me alone Its nothing serious I'll do it myself Its got nothing to do with you And there's nothing that you could do  You can see it and you can almost hear it too You can almost taste it Its nothing to do with you And there's nothing that you can do  So come in my cave And I'll burn your heart away Come in my cave And I'll burn your heart away  Please close your ears and try to look away So you'll never hear a single word I say And don't ever come my way  So come in my cave And I'll burn your heart away So come in my cave And arrest me for my mistakes "
