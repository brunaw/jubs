Who'll wait what seems When we'll play The eternal time To burn us out? We make it now  Catch me again The future should forgive the misery In these twenty years Why what belongs you remained sane?  You, everything Why this? Who'll wait what seems When we'll play The eternal time To burn us out? We make it now  You, everything Why this? Who'll wait what seems When we'll play The eternal time To burn us out? We make it now"
