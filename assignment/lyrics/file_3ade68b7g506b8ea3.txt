"1" "Open the skies over me I am waiting patiently I'll wait for a sign As conspiracies unwind Will you slam shut or free your mind Or stay hypnotised?  When the Zetas fill the skies Will our leaders tell us why? Fully loaded satellites Will target nothing but our minds!  Well I'm waiting patiently Well I'll wait for the sign  Carried through the centuries Secrets locked up And loaded on my back Well it weighs me down...  When the Zetas fill the skies It's just our leaders in disguise! Fully loaded satellites Will target nothing but our minds!  Well I'm waiting patiently Well I'll wait for the sign Well I'm waiting patiently But I'll wait for the sign"
