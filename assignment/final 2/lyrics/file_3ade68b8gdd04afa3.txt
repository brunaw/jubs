"1" "Is your secret safe tonight? And are we out of sight? Or will our world come tumbling down?  Will they find our hiding place? Is this our last embrace? Or will the walls start caving in?  (It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it should've been right (It could be wrong, could be wrong) Let our hearts ignite (It could be wrong, could be wrong) Are we digging a hole? (It could be wrong, could be wrong) This is outta control  (It could be wrong, could be wrong) It could never last (It could be wrong, could be wrong) Must erase it fast (It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it could've been right (It could be wrong, could be...)  Love is our resistance They keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down And hold me, our lips must always be sealed  If we live our life in fear I'll wait a thousand years Just to see you smile again  Quell your prayers for love and peace You'll wake the thought police We can hide the truth inside  (It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it should've been right (It could be wrong, could be wrong) Let our hearts ignite (It could be wrong, could be wrong) Are we digging a hole? (It could be wrong, could be wrong) This is outta control  (It could be wrong, could be wrong) It could never last (It could be wrong, could be wrong) Must erase it fast (It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it could've been right (It could be wrong, could be...)  Love is our resistance! They keep us apart and won't stop breaking us down And hold me, our lips must always be sealed  The night has reached its end We can't pretend We must run We must run It's time to run  Take us away from here Protect us from further harm Resistance!"
