"1" "It's happening soon, it's happening soon, its scent has been blowing in my direction. To me it is new, to me it is new, and it's not gonna change for anybody. And it's gonna be our last memory, And its led me on, and on to you.  It's got to be here, it's got to be there, its got to be now or I'll lose for ever. To me it is strange, this feeling is strange, but it's not going to change for anybody. And it's gonna be our last memory, And it's led me on And on to you  Accuse me, Trust me, I never knew, That you were the one, you were the one, oooh.  And it's gonna be our last memory, And it's led me on, and on to you. And it's gonna be our last memory, And it's led me on, and on to you. You."
