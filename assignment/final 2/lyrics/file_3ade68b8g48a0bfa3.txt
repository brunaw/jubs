"1" "It breaks my heart to leave you far behind it breaks me up to leave so suddenly knowing we might never meet again It hurts so much to lose another friend  I could hope you're just as sad to see me go but I'd hate to be the cause of grief to someone I like so Knowing we might never meet again It hurts so much to lose another friend."
