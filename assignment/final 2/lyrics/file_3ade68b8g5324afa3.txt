"1" "When these pillars get pulled down, It will be you who wears a crown, And I'll owe everything to you  How much pain has cracked your soul? How much love would make you whole? You're my guiding lightning strike  I can't find the words to say, But they're overdue, I've traveled half the world to say, I belong to you  Then she attacks me like a Leo, When my heart is split like Rio, But, I assure you my debts are real  I can't find the words to say, When I'm confused, I've traveled half the world to say, You are my muse  (Ah! Reponds ma tendresse, Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse, Reponds ma tendresse, Reponds ma tendresse, Ah! Verse-moi l'ivresse, Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse, Reponds ma tendresse, Reponds ma tendresse, Ah! Verse-moi l'ivresse, I belong, I belong to you alone)  Muse, I can't find the words to say, But they're overdue, I've traveled half the world to say, I belong to you"
