"1" "Eerie whispers Trapped beneath my pillow You won't let me sleep  Your memories  And I know you're in this room I'm sure I heard you sigh Floating in between  Where our worlds collide  Scares the hell out of me And the end is all I can see  It scares the hell out of me And the end is all I can see  Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oaaahh  And I know the moment's near And there's nothing we can do Look through a faithless eye Are you afraid to die?  It scares the hell out of me And the end is all I can see  It scares the hell out of me And the end is all I can see  Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oaaahh  It scares the hell out of me And the end is all I can see  It scares the hell out of me And the end is all I can see   Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oaaahh"
