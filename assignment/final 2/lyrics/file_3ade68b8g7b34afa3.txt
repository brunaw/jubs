"1" "Aping my soul You stole my overture Trapped in God's program And I can't escape  Who are we? Where are we? When are we? Why are we? Who are we? Where are we? Why, why, why?  I can't forgive you, And I can't forget  Who are we? Where are we? When are we? Why are we?  Who are we? Where are we? When are we? Why we in here?"
