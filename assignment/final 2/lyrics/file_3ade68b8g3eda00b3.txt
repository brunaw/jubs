In all energy exchanges, if no energy enters or leaves an isolated system, the entropy of that system increases.  Energy continuously flows from being concentrated,  to becoming dispersed, spread out, wasted and useless. New energy cannot be created and high grade energy is being destroyed.  An economy based on endless growth isâ€¦  Un-sus-tain-able! Un-sus... Unsustain, unsustain, unsust... Un-s... un-s...  Unsustainable, Unsustainable un-sus...  Unsustain, unsustain, unsust... Un-sus... un-sus... You're un-sus-tain-able!  The fundamental laws of thermodynamics  will place fixed limits on technological innovation and human endorsement. In an isolated system, the entropy can only increase. A species set on endless growth is...  Un-sus-tain-able! Un-sus... Unsustain, unsustain, unsust... Un-s... un-s...
