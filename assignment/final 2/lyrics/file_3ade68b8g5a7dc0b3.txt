"1" "See you standing Wish you want me just a little bit Wish you love me just a little bit Cause now I want it all the time And I know that it's no crime But I don't know why  Now I want it all the time But I know that it's no crime But I don't know why  Now we're holding all the time Two can sing to no longer mind I hope that you will see me through Through the Backdoor Looking out for a jack-door For all the things that we hoped for Thrown it in a pool of fear Pool of fear"
